# Explore Quantum Frontiers: Calculating Atoms 
This repository is for the 2025 February Build Project through Open Avenues. This project introduces key ideas of quantum physics to solve for to solve for one-dimensional and two-dimensional Ising models.

## Requirements
This project requires the following Python packages:

* NumPy
* matplotlib
* time
* cProfile

## Background
### Understanding the 1D Ising model

### Understanding the 2D Ising model
